# Intro
Thanks for your interest in this project. I am a marketing professional with no formal background in coding.
A couple of years ago I've started coding some tools for my daily work.
This year I've decided to open these tools as opensource so that other professionals can use them as well.

# Project Vision
The goal of this project is to provide marketing professionals with a simple tool to monitor chosen keywords monthly searches in targeted cities.
Thus giving information about changes in that market demand. This tool is not intended to be used for S.E.O planning as many tools exist for this.

We want to provide a free hosted solution for end users at [Market Demand Analysis](http://marketdemandanalysis.com), therefore this repositoy is for development purposes. We have no intention of providing custom installers for self-hosted solutions.

# Contributions and roadmap
I would be very happy with collaborators for this project. I've been working with these concepts for many years using google keyword tool. 
But have very little knowledge in programming. Altough IÂ´ve made a working prototype of the project. Please contact me at thiagoc@gmail.com

### Collaboration Needed
a) Experience programmers to improve code and usability
b) Marketing professionals and researchers to test real use cases
